# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them. It also includes a random task suggestion feature when the input field is left empty.

## Features:
1. **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add" button or pressing the Enter key.
2. **Complete Tasks**: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on them, which will strike them through.
3. **Remove Tasks**: Users can remove tasks by clicking on the delete icon next to the task.
4. **Task Suggestion**: If the input field is left empty, a random task is suggested.
5. **Persistent Data**: The tasks are stored in local storage, so even if the page is reloaded, the tasks will persist.
